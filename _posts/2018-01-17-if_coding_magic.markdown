Since I remember learning how to type I've watched the wonderful wizardry of miraculous magicians making meaningful impact on my life.  Most people remember the smell of the wind when they first learned how to ride a bike but for me I distinctly remember everything about my first typing class in kindergarten (circa 1992).  I remember the pig pen(what?) that they lured me in with, and the rows of machines with tiny screens.  I remember the brown trailer and white desks, the feathered hair of my teacher, but even more I loved using software.  Screens were lighting up and responding while programs loaded from larger floppy disks.  As i learned finger placement and typing techniques, writing became much easier then manually with a pencil.  
I was hooked.  Glued to a screen of some sort for the rest of my life.  I remember having a `Cybico` in the 5th grade, which was like a ti-83/gameboy/2way messenger that used actual radio signals to send data (like 20 feet between units if there was no wall).  As I grew up in an increasingly more tech driven and influenced world I learned a lot about rooting android devices, how to optimize my PC, etc... But at the end of the day I always used the awesome products of other geniuses.  I was always a power but just enough to truly understand and appreciate the intricacies of compiling data and code into a usable software or utility.
College presented my first opportunities to dance around the possibilities of learning how to code.  I took a logic class that was super difficult but really left me with a sense of accomplishment.  I decided to attempt a class half in my major (psychology) and half in the computer sciences.  This class dealt with making functions for a program that used data driven response times of the human body.  In a sense we could program a virtual representation of a human body to respond and interact to stimulus.  The class was very comprehensive in a lot of fields that I just happened to have a decent familiarity and I excelled well.  Riding this wave, I took COMPSCI 101 and with an intro to coding class.  I remember my first day of COMPSCI and hitting a huge learning wall and never recovering.  I dropped the class well within the timeframe to enroll into another psych class and play it safe.  I remained in intro to programing and did well conceptualizing the material, but immediately when labs went began working with C++ I felt so incapable and again was hard to come back.  I ended up doing ok in the class by just getting by that College kids can do. 

Programing has come a long way and a lot more tools are available for people trying to peel back the mystery.  Through my searches I have done some basic courser and EDx stuff but nothing hitting roadblocks just seemed so much more difficult to overcome on those platforms, having TCâ€™s during the prep courses has really helped me learn at a much more accelerated pace then I could imagine.  Super pumped to be in the program and hoping for the best.
