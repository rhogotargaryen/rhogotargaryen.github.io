My Job hunting experience has really picken up steam this week and I am excited to share some of the insights and advices from my own (continuing) journey as well as those I have networked with along the way.

Traditional schooling has habitualized me to train for the "endgame".  We have finals and test that skip the easy stuff and test our upper level understanding of the advanced concepts in the class. I certainly appreciate the Flatiron method of teaching web development, learning in an inductive manner (learning the fundamentals first and building up from them) was a great way to learn and I feel puts us students in a much better position in understanding of some of the complexities of modern waeb development. It seems however in the hiring process at times can run against these principles.  What i have found is time and energy should be focused on primarily running vanilla Js and specifically manipulating the DOM using script tags.

Most challenges will focus on logic puzzle-like questions in a timed environment and vanilla JS will be used to solve them as an extension of your ability to problem solve.  I have also found that you might be asked to add features not currently present in HTML5, for example i was asked to create a "triple click" event listener while current only single and double clicks are natively supporter. 

An awesome source for the hiring process in the tech field offered some great insight on why recruiters want to see this being done on both Sr and Jr levels.  She conjured the scenario of a Sr dev in he recuitment process given a minimal task with skeleton HTML and some constant data.  Senior Devs loading React cdn's would actually score lower in her book because there really is no need and could lead potential employers to beleive that the Sr dev can only code in a certain framework.  Furthermore she said most hiring managers can cast a wider net analyzing fundamental JS sklls versus skills in a specific framework (angular AND react devs vs a OR scenario).

Another contact and I discussed the stress a small time limitation or an extra set of eyes can have while coding.  Though not impossible to break out of there is a real effect of being "under the gun" and I was not prepared my first go around.  Practice helps and also having the confidence to have a "take whatever" is thrown my way attitude.  I think Coding Challenges websites are an invaluable website to prepare for tests and some popular ones are used as actual platforms to test potential employees.

The stress of finding a job can be real, and almost all my contacts had mentioned the same thing, they also empathesized and shared stories of their similar starts, it was really motivating to know A LOT of people have been in my situatiion and are in our corners.  It takes to gain entrance into the tech/dev field but am glad that when reaching out there are those willing to support.
