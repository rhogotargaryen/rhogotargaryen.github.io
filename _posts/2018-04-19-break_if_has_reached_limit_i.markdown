Recently I have hit a huge roadbloack in developing my app.  After a binge coding session, something broke and I couldnt figure out what happened.  I spent about am hour working through my process and nothing seemed out of place. I kept diving deeper and deeper into my code, sinnatra, acrtiverecord, etc and could not find a solution.   Scheduled a 1:1 and still wasnt able to make progress.  To make things worse in my panic I somehow deleted my whole application controller.  wound << salt I did not have a very competent commit habbit and I lost a LOT of functionality.

BREAK

I had reached my limit and decided it was best to take a day off and come back to it tomorrow.  This was so hard, like an itch I couldnt scratch all day I went to bed and woke up with it on my mind.  I felt like i suffered a lost.  An like a moth to flame I was in front of my screen.  AWS really impressed me.  Diving into the cloud dev environment a little i found a really awesome document rollback feature and was able to get a LOT of my code back.  Spurred by the positive energy I contacted the section lead Kenlyn who has been such an awesome resource and we scheduled a 1 : 1 for the next day.  I was able to finally relax and love outside my app for the rest of the day.

The 1 : 1 with Kenlyn was exactly the positive push I needed to overcome my earlier dilemna and just work through the code.  Her enthusiasm and excitement for the little I had accomplished at the time really boosted my confidence and made me feel proud and inspired for what was to come.  By the end of that day I had created for my first time a functioning web app and it is very hard to describe the feeling.  Ive never been a great artist, athlete, handtmand, etc. but i felt for once I had obtained that organic feeling of being able to craftsomething from mind to reality.  It feels so good and I am so happy of the result.  I hope to post it on heroku for demonstration purposes. will update!
